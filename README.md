Minesweeper is a simple version of the classic game coded on Swift where users have to flag 10 mines. The user can toggle between two nodes when clicking on a square: flag and dig mode.
The game follows the regular rules of the game and when a blank square is dug, all the adjacent blank squares are revealed also.

When the user digs a mine, the game ends and all of the location of the mines are revealed. If the user has successfully flagged all of the mines and dug all the safe spaces, the user wins the game.
